# Clojure Implementations of Caolan McMahon's async.parallel and async.map

The is a re-implementation of Caolan McMahon's [https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel](parallel) and
[Caolan McMahon's](map) functions from [https://github.com/caolan/async](async).

This code works in both ClojureScript and Clojure however the style is derived from the target language of ClojureScript and I doubt you would want to write this style of code in Clojure itself.
