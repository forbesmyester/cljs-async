# Clojure Implementations of Caolan McMahon's async.parallel and async.map

The is a re-implementation of Caolan McMahon's [parallel](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel) and
[map](https://github.com/caolan/async#map) functions from [async](https://github.com/caolan/async).

This code works in both ClojureScript and Clojure however the style is derived from the target language of JavaScript and I doubt you would want to write this style of code in Clojure itself.
